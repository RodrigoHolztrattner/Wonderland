# Wonderland
A 3D vulkan rendering framework attempt
(still under development)

This is a framework developed under the new graphic API: Vulkan. The main idea is to develop a wrapper that makes using this API easier. The framework itself supports 2D and 3D rendering as well as making use of several modules built by me to manage parallel processing and file processing.
All the main files are within the path: /Wonderland/Editor/
